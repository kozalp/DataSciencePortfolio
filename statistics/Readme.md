# DESCRIPTION

Here, I tested a sample data whether it is normally distributed. This is something I did when I was studying plankton swimming patterns in my Ph.D. thesis. 

To check normality, I performed:

1. a qualitative analysis on the distribution
2. a calculation kurtosis to quantify how much the distribution deviates from the normal
3. a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test
4. Shapiro-Wilk test to get a second opinion. The Shapiro-Wilk test has more power than the K-S test and is more reliable.
